# Patterns Catalog DRAFT

The [Patterns Operator] is adding a Patterns Catalog feature. This feature
provides a custom OpenShift console plugin that allows users to view and
deploy available patterns from a catalog.

The catalog is populated from one or more YAML files called *Pattern Catalog
Definitions*. A Pattern Catalog Definition file contains metadata about the
organization providing the patterns and metadata about the patterns themselves.

This repository contains the default Pattern Catalog Definition file for the
[Hybrid Cloud Patterns] project. It is automatically imported when the Patterns
Operator is installed.

If your organization wants to create their own Pattern Catalog Definition, you
should:

* Fork this repo
* Update catalog.yaml
* Create a [PatternCatalogSource] on your cluster pointed to your forked
  catalog.yaml
* After a few moments the patterns from your catalog.yaml file should appear in
  the Pattern Catalog.

If you are using your own Pattern Catalog Definition, it's possible to delete
the default PatternCatalogSource:

```bash
oc delete patterncatalogsource default -n patterns-operator
```

## Example Catalog YAML
