    description: A horizontal solution for multicluster DevSecOps use cases
    longDescription: >
      This pattern demonstrates a horizontal solution for multicluster
      DevSecOps use cases. It is derived from the multi-cloud GitOps pattern
      with added products to provide a complete DevSecOps workflow. This
      includes CI/CD pipelines with security gates; image scanning, signing and
      storage in a secure registry; deployment to secured clusters that provide
      advanced security monitoring and alerting.

    description: A horizontal solution for Industrial Edge use cases
    longDescription: >
      This pattern demonstrates a horizontal solution for Industrial Edge use
      cases. It is derived from the MANUela work done by Red Hat Middleware
      Solution Architects in Germany in 2019/20. The name MANUela stands for
      MANUfacturing Edge Lightweight Accelerator, you will see this acronym in
      a lot of artifacts.
