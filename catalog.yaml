    description: A simple architecture for managing multiple clusters using GitOps
    longDescription: >
      This pattern demonstrates a simple architecture for managing multiple
      clusters using GitOps. It can be used as a good starting point for
      experimenting with other products in a multi-cluster architecture.

  - name: Medical Diagnosis
    description: A pattern for doing AI/Ml on images
    longDescription: >
      This pattern demonstrates a simple architecture for deploying an images
      recognition and processing application. This Validated Pattern is based 
      on a demo implementation of an automated data pipeline for chest Xray analysis 
      previously developed by Red Hat. The original demo can be found here. It 
      was developed for the US Department of Veteran Affairs.

  - name: Multicluster DevSecOps
    description: A horizontal solution for multicluster DevSecOps use cases
    longDescription: >
      This pattern demonstrates a horizontal solution for multicluster
      DevSecOps use cases. It is derived from the multi-cloud GitOps pattern
      with added products to provide a complete DevSecOps workflow. This
      includes CI/CD pipelines with security gates; image scanning, signing and
      storage in a secure registry; deployment to secured clusters that provide
      advanced security monitoring and alerting.

  - name: Industrial Edge
    description: A horizontal solution for Industrial Edge use cases
    longDescription: >
      This pattern demonstrates a horizontal solution for Industrial Edge use
      cases. It is derived from the MANUela work done by Red Hat Middleware
      Solution Architects in Germany in 2019/20. The name MANUela stands for
      MANUfacturing Edge Lightweight Accelerator, you will see this acronym in
      a lot of artifacts.

    description: This pattern demonstrates a pattern that models the store side of a retail application.
    longDescription: >
      This pattern demonstrates a pattern that models the store side of a retail application.
      It is derived from the Quarkus Coffeeshop Demo done by Red Hat Solution Architects. 
      The demo models the use of multiple application microservices which use Kafka messaging 
      to interact and a Postgres database to persist data. (There is a homeoffice analytics 
      suite in the demo that we hope to include in a later version of the pattern.
      This demo pulls together several different strands of the demo and allows for multiple
      stores to be installed on remote clusters via ACM if the user desires.
      The demo allows users to go to the store’s web page, order drinks and food items, 
      and see those items “made” and served by the microservices in real time.
      The pattern includes build pipelines and a demo space, so that changes to the 
      applications can be tested prior to “production” deployments.
